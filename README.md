TicTacToe Kata
==============

This repo has a starting position for doing the TicTacToe Kata with an Approval testing approach. It includes a printer which can print a game board using ASCII art. There is only enough of an implementation to support this. Your job is to implement the rest of the software so the game can be played.

Deciphering the ASCII Art
-------------------------

A this is a sample printout from the board printer:

	  0 1 2.
	0 x   o.
	1      .
	2     x.

This represents a board with following pieces played:

- 'x' at position (0, 0)
- 'o' at position (2, 0)
- 'x' at position (2, 2)

Note: the reason for the extra dot '.' at the end of each line is so that the IDE doesn't rstrip the lines and break your tests every time you look at the approved files.
